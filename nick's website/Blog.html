          <h1>Free/Libre Software (PART 1)</h1>
          <p>At some point in a CS major's academic or professional career, they will probably learn about the "open source"
movement. But most won't hear about the free software movement (Free as in freedom, not free as in price). The "open
source" movement is about making the source code to your software available for others to study. If developers don't do
this, it becomes prohibitively difficult for other developers to understand what their code is doing, even if they know
the language it's written in. So the point of "open source" is to get developers to consider to release the code to
their program. The "open source" movement seems well-intentioned. But it doesn't go far enough.
<br/>
<br/>
The "open source" movement was adopted by industry because it is more "business friendly". It doesn't require any pesky
ethical commitments. "Open source" actually takes the ideas of free software, and excludes the most important
principles behind it. The free software movement, at its core, is about a commitment to make ethical software. That is,
software that does not mistreat its users. There are four essential freedoms outlined by the
<a href="https://www.fsf.org/" target=_blank>free software foundation</a>, which define free software. They are as
follows:
<br/>
<br/>
Freedom 0. The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
<br/>
Freedom 1. The freedom to study the program and change it as you wish. (Source code required for this)
<br/>
Freedom 2. The freedom to distribute perfect copies to others.
<br/>
Freedom 3. The freedom to distribute modified copies to others. (Source code required for this)
<br/>
<br/>
These freedoms are necessary for protecting the community of developers and the end users. To take away any of these
freedoms is to put the developer in a position of power over the users and other developers. Proprietary software
strips developers of the ability to modify and share the software by either keeping the source code secret, or
copyrighting it so that sharing the software and making improvements on it. Only the rights holder is permitted to do
that. For everyone else, it is both illegal due to the copyright and infeasable due to not having the source code. If
the owner of said program decides to add anti-features, such as malware, spying capability, universal backdoors, or
restrictive user agreements you must enter into before using the software, then the users of that program are powerless
to say no. Because the source code is not available, whether the proprietary program contains those malicious features
is not known. And it is often prohibitively difficult to find out since you would have to reverse engineer the program
in order to be sure that it does not.
<br/>
<br/>
When programmers grant these freedoms by releasing the source code and giving the program a copyleft license, it is
more difficult to inject malware into the program since someone else might see that reflected in the source code.
Imagine there is a feature that users want. With free software, you can "fork" a project, creating your own modified 
version, and you are free to share that modified version with anyone. Well maybe not you specifically, but a programmer 
with the know how can. If you are a non-programmer, you may convince a programmer to implement the changes you desire, 
especially if many other users want the same change. This protects the community giving users a say in what changes are 
made and giving developers the right to make changes. Access to the source code makes changing the program possible. 
And copyleft or free licensing gives everyone the legal right to modify and share the program. If there is a feature of
the program that people don't like, developers can create their own version of the program with that feature removed. 
This disincentivizes adding any malicious features since they can be caught and removed freely.
<br/>

In the next section, I will talk in more detail about the ways proprietary programs mistreat the user.</p>
