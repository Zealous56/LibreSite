You can reach me through email at: <a href="mailto:nicholasjohnson@posteo.org">nicholasjohnson@posteo.org</a>

Note 1: I highly recommend encrypting your message with my PGP public key before emailing me. I would much rather 
receive PGP encrypted emails than plaintext emails since using PGP shows a commitment to protecting yourself and me 
against email surveillance. If you do not know how to use PGP, you can learn 
<a href="http://www.bitcoinnotbombs.com/beginners-guide-to-pgp/" target=_blank>here</a>. Please don't forget to include
your public key so that I can send encrypted messages back to you. I am aware of the 
<a href="https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/otr-wpes.pdf" target=_blank>problems with PGP</a>. However, it is the most widely
used cross platform method for email encryption right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Note 2: You may have noticed my email ends in @posteo.org. <a href="https://posteo.de/en" target=_blank>Posteo</a> is a
green, ad-free email service. You get 2 GB of email storage upon sign up. Their business is powered by 100% green 
energy from Greenpeace Energy. They also claim to optionally encrypt your emails for added security. This means 
encrypting your emails on their disks. It does nothing for email in transit. They don't require any personal 
information and you can pay anonymously. <a href="https://posteo.de/en/site/wedonateto" target=_blank> Posteo also 
donates to other human rights and environmental organizations</a>. And it only costs 1 EUR per month to have an
account. Posteo releases all the <a href="https://posteo.de/js-licenses.html" target=_blank>Javascript source code and
licenses</a> for its site as well. I admire their dedication to an ethical and sustainable business model and highly 
recommend Posteo. There are other features they offer that I haven't even mentioned here. Please visit their site (link
above) for more info. </p>
