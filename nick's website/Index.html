          <h1>Bolte</h1>
          <p>The Bitcoin network has been around for nearly a decade now. Over the past few years, I have been following recent
developments in distributed ledger technology. I decided it's time I write my own blockchain to better understand it,
programatically speaking. <a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Bolte" target=_blank>Bolte</a> is more a demo how
blockchain technology works than a real implementation. As you can see in the
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Bolte/blob/master/TODO.txt" target=_blank>TODO</a>, there are many aspects of
blockchain that I would eventually like to program. I plan on extending this project at a later date, but for now I
will postpone further development as I have hit a roadblock. I need more practice in Python and in building
multifaceted, networked applications.
<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to have accomplished a basic demo in a language I have had only a few days practice using. In Bolte, you can
see examples of the structure of blockchain and blocks, transactions (without digital signatures), proof of work, and
state in <a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Bolte/blob/master/blockchain.py" target=_blank>blockchain.py</a>.
Validation examples are in a separate module named <a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Bolte/blob/master/validator.py"
target=_blank>validator.py</a>.</p>

          <h1>LibreSite</h1>
          <p>What is LibreSite? You're looking at it! Well, sort of. LibreSite is the template for the site you are looking at. I
wrote it myself. So in a way, there is a recursion since you are reading about the site template on the site itself.
I wrote LibreSite for gaining experience with HTML and CSS. A central goal was also to create a website that respects
the user visiting it. For example, not requiring the user to run foreign Javascript on their computer just to view the
site. Also, by respecting the privacy of the user by downloading custom fonts locally instead of from Google Fonts.
This way, Google isn't necessarily alerted who is visiting my site and when. And finally, I have made
<a href="https://github.com/0gitnick/LibreSite" target=_blank>the code</a> for generating the template to this site
freely available for anyone to run, copy, modify, and share.
<br>
<br>
As we were learning pug in databases and web design class, I decided I would write LibreSite using it. I also used
Node.js to compile the pug. All of this worked out well. What did not work out so well was trying to write my own CSS
stylesheet. Lesson learned. I will never try that again. Spending hours debugging and trying to make a flexible layout
is not worth the time. There are stylesheets online that take care of all that for you such as
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/" target=_blank>w3css from w3schools</a>. Another thing that could be improved
right now is the flexibility of the layout, meaning more options for easy user styling, as well as a less hacky content
management system, which currently just reads from text files. Overall, I learned a lot and I'm still proud of what
I've accomplished.</p>

          <h1>Numbers-to-Words</h1>
          <p>The project is self-explanatory. It converts numbers into words. For example, 65 becomes "sixty five". The algorithm
was not copied. I thought it up on my own although I'm positive it's unoriginal. It was my first experience in both
inventing an algorithm and then putting it into code. If you look at the
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Numbers-to-Words/commit/3579d3d5aabd803d2ddc4a7550463aea7d688e84" target=_blank>
first commit</a>, you will notice how awful the code structure is. It even makes me want to cringe looking back on it!
That code came from an old project written years ago that I wrote but never released. I committed the initial code to
show from where I started, rather than rewriting the algorithm from scratch. It had many problems. Nearly all of the
first 81 lines are unnecessary variable declarations. On line 144, there is a for loop that executed 3 times more often
than needed. Lines 150-152 are try/catch blocks where the exception is immediately caught to prevent an
arrayIndexOutOfBoundsException which should not happen. On top of that there is a reverseString() function which can
be thrown out entirely. The variable declarations at the beginning also have meaningless names. The variables later
create a problem that cascades down the rest of the program forcing parts of the code to be up to forty times longer
than <a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Numbers-to-Words/blob/master/src/edu/siue/njohnag/NumbersToWords.java"
target=_blank>the optimized version</a> I finished.
<br/>
<br/>
The project has <a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Numbers-to-Words/blob/master/src/edu/siue/njohnag/Testbench.java"
target=_blank>thorough unit testing</a> which actually helped me uncover bugs. In the optimized algorithm, I removed
the excessive variables, fixed the loop, and replaced the try/catches.</p>

          <h1>Sorting-Algorithms</h1>
          <p>Simple sorting algorithms in C++. All my previous work was in Java, so I thought it was time to change things up. Most
all <a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Sorting-Algorithms/tree/master/edu.siue.njohnag/algorithms" target=_blank>the
sorting algorithms</a> I wrote need to swap two elements in an array. So there is a
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/edu.siue.njohnag/algorithms/swap.cpp"
target=_blank>swap.cpp file</a> separated from the rest of the cpp files that execute the algorithms. The
implementations are not my own. This project was an exercise in learning the algorithm by writing it, not inventing my
own implementation.
<br/>
<br/>
My favorite algorithms are recursive. Unfortunately recursion is memory inefficient and is often replaced in industry
code by loop structures for that reason. My all time favorite is
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/edu.siue.njohnag/algorithms/quicksort.cpp"
target=_blank>quicksort</a> for its simplicity and flexibility. Because you are free to choose any pivot point, you can
optimize quicksort to suit your dataset.
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/edu.siue.njohnag/algorithms/insertionsort.cpp"
target=_blank>Insertion</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/edu.siue.njohnag/algorithms/selectionsort.cpp"
target=_blank>selection sort</a> are very similar.
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/edu.siue.njohnag/algorithms/bubblesort.cpp"
target=_blank>Bubble sort</a> is interesting since its swapping is more dynamic.
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Sorting-Algorithms/blob/master/edu.siue.njohnag/algorithms/radixsort.cpp"
target=_blank>Radix sort</a> was my least favorite algorithm. I found it unintuitive and boring to program. Although I
can't argue with the efficiency and might use it in a future project.</p>

          <h1>Diceware-GUI</h1>
          <p>I can't code just to code. I must have an end goal in mind and a strong purpose helps. For
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Diceware-GUI" target=_blank>Diceware-GUI</a>, the purpose was simply to create a
graphical interface for the <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html" target=_blank>Diceware method of
generating passwords</a>. For those who don't know, Diceware was concocted by Arnold G. Reinhold. It is a method for
generating secure, memorable passwords. Why not just use a
<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31435/password-manager" target=_blank> password manager</a>? There are
certain scenarios where password managers are inappropriate. For example, what will the password to your password
manager be? Generating a secure password for your manager and writing it down to remember it is no good. Someone may
find it. Trying to remember it is impractical since it's a bunch of scrambled generated characters. What do you do?
That's where Diceware comes in.
<br/>
<br/>
Simply roll some die as your source of randomness and match them with the numbers on the Diceware list. There is a
one-to-one mapping from each number to a unique word. Generate enough words and concatenate them into one password, and
lo and behold, you have a secure password. And more importantly, with a little effort, you can remember the password.
Because what good is having a password you can't remember?
<br/>
<br/>
I would caution you not to make your own word list, since the letter frequency of the list is important. The lists
found on the Diceware website have been crafted to be secure. They are available in many languages and I highly
recommend reading through the <a href="http://world.std.com/%7Ereinhold/diceware.html" target=_blank>original Diceware
website</a> for more detailed information.
<br/>
<br/>
My program is fairly simple. It uses a basic GUI and some regex magic to read out all the lists of any language. The
Java SecureRandom class is utilized for generating random numbers. While a useful tool, I would still highly recommend
generating passwords by hand with <a href="http://world.std.com/%7Ereinhold/dicewarefaq.html#casino" target=_blank>
casino grade dice</a> for added security, since your passphrase is only as secure as the source of randomness. If you
use my program to generate passwords, keep in mind that the password is only as secure as the computer you generate
them on. Also, my program is not thoroughly tested or audited by a third party, and I did not unit test it. So I would
avoid using it for serious security purposes. I wouldn't rely on anyone else's programs for Diceware either unless they
had been security audited. The best way to avoid this problem is to just use real dice.</p>

          <h1>RomanNumeral</h1>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/RomanNumeral" target=_blank>Roman Numeral</a> was my first practice in creating a
pure function Java class. It has exception handling and uses abstract. It can convert an integer into a roman numeral
string using toRoman() or roman numeral strings to integers using toRoman(). Also, it is well-documented. Rather than
not writing enough comments, I have the opposite tendency. I tend to over comment my code. In this project, there is
so little code and so much documentation, it seems like 40% of the program is just documentation.</p>

          <h1>Rational</h1>
          <p>My first project. I learned to use Github and make commits. There is a
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Rational/blob/master/src/edu/siue/njohnag/Fraction.java" target=_blank>class for
integer primitives</a>. There is also a
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Rational/blob/master/src/edu/siue/njohnag/BigFraction.java" target=_blank>class
that supports BigInteger</a>. Both classes are well documented. I also unit tested them in
<a href="https://github.com/0Gitnick/Rational/blob/master/src/edu/siue/njohnag/FracTest.java" target=_blank>
FracTest.java</a>. The rational objects are internally represented as a numerator and denominator. Representing the
rational object as a float or double would be unworkable for several reasons. Rationals are operated on much the same
way you would do the operations by hand, so reading the classes' code should be intuitive if you know basic Java and
are familiar with rational numbers.</p>
